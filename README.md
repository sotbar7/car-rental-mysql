A car rental company wants to develop a relational database to monitor customers, rentals, fleet and locations. The company's fleet consists of cars of different types. A car is described via a unique code (VIN), a description, color, brand, model, and date of purchase. A car may belong to one (exactly one) vehicle category (compact, economy, convertible, etc.). Each category is described by a unique ID, a label and a detailed description. The company has several locations around the globe. Each location has a unique ID, an address (street, number, city, state, country) and one or more telephone numbers. The company should also store in this database its customers. A customer is described by a unique ID, SSN, Name (First, Last), email, mobile phone number and lives in a state and country. Customers rent a car, which they pickup from a location and return it another location (not necessarily the same.) A rental is described by a unique reservation number, it has an amount and contains the pickup date and the return date.
